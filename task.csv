Although I have been trading for a few years, I want to understand how algorithms and other forms of mathematical modeling can influence investment strategies. Additionally, the Strategy Implementation team intrigues me because it would allow me to grasp the real-world implementations of quantitative trading and employ market research from the Quantitative Research team. ",As much time is necessary,"I will bring an eager attitude and determined mindset to Quant. I have always been one to dive into new avenues ready to give it my all; and Quant will be no different. Although I have basic investment experience, I will go into Quant knowing that I have lots to learn and am willing to dedicate as much time and effort as is needed to help Quant thrive. Additionally, I will come to Quant with an open-mind and adaptability; being prepared to work with my colleagues to solve any problems that we come across.","I hope to connect myself with a community of like-minded individuals who share my passion for investing and create long-lasting relationships with the colleagues I work alongside. Also, I want to better understand Quantitative Finance and how Quant's different teams work together to develop new strategies. Most of all, I hope that Quant teaches me something that I didn't know before joining, and offers me and my colleagues a better understanding of our world. ",

I am excited to work with others and deploy live trading strategies",5-10 hours,"I am proficient with Python, Linux, and am familiar with several useful libraries. Further, I've personally worked on developing algorithmic strategies so I am very familiar with modeling financial data. I have deployed strategies live and can program broker APIs. I am confident that I can use my skills to add value in many parts of the organization.",I hope to gain further experience in the field and meet like minded people.,
12/20/2021 17:03:54,William Dickson,Sophomore,computer science ,,,,3.7,Software Development,"This team interests me because I want to use my software skills to contribute to new a sector of technology. I think the overlap of math, finance, and computer science can lead to innovative ways to predict and calculate financial models. The team also interests me because incorporating computer science to other fields like finance feels as if the skills i'm learning as a direct impact on real world applications.",5 hours,"I hope to bring my skills in software development and my understanding in how to contribute well designed code in a larger team setting. I also am currently a member at Hack4Impact, so I will bring the knowledge I've learned as a team member on how to develop and design a product that will have a valuable outreach.",I hope to learn new finance knowledge and skills in data analysis. I also hope to meet new people from this organization as well as develop professional connections with members and affiliated organizations.,
12/20/2021 17:42:11,Wanda Black,Master's,Computer Science,,,,4,"Strategy Implementation, Quantitative Research","Given my background in machine learning research and software engineering via internships and work experiences at Apple and Visa, I'm exciting to build data-driven algorithms to guide quantitative research on financial markets on the Quant Research team. I have created, trained and productionized privacy-preserving deep learning models at scale, had my fair share of experience with NLP in industry settings, and sentiment analysis projects at my research lab, in personal projects, and in academic coursework.

Similarly, I'm also interested in realizing algorithms and drawing correlations between different asset classes with the Strategy Implementation team. I have worked on ETLs and large-scale data migrations using AWS, Scala, Go, Python, and am proficient and data scraping, parsing, and analysis from work and personal projects.

Happy to share more details if needed.",10-15,"I'm currently a graduate student at UIUC studying computer science with a data science concentration, here to extend my knowledge upon my undergraduate degrees in computer science and cognitive science. In undergrad, I was extremely involved on-campus, as chairman of undergraduate student government, and president of three tech organizations. I hope that I can continue to get involved with communities outside of the classroom, specifically Quant at UIUC. 

In terms of value, I'm a team player, strong leadership skills (time management, consensus building, delegation, reliability, issue resolution, etc given I manage large-scale programs in my day job as a Product Manager), and genuine interest in exploring this quantitative finance and research. I'm reliable and deliver results on time and to the highest quality standards.","I'm super interested in finance (currently considering making a pivot from tech to finance in a front-office role at a bulge-bracket firm), so I have the fundamentals down from that perspective (although, not sure how entirely helpful that would be here).

I hope to find a community here at UIUC, while also growing my knowledge and understanding of this fascinating intersection between tech and finance.",

I've had a lot of interest in getting into quant trading after looking at a company called Jane Street, however I never knew how considering I was a regular finance/info systems major. I'd love to get involved to gain more knowledge on the subject. I am interested in every team however I would like to learn more about each one in person then select 2 that I would like to dedicate most of my time to.",2-4 hours,"Diversity of thought is something I feel like I could contribute heavily with. There aren't many business majors on this campus who have developed their own apps. I developed the app iCover with a friend of mine, and since our release in late October, we have grown to 800+ downloads. I would love to help quant grow, secure more corporate partners, and help more students on our campus get into quant trading.","I would love to work with a team of another bright students in different fields and see what investing advancements we could make. A goal of mine has been to start a hedge fund, and I think that Quant is a great opportunity to not only meet intelligent students to make a team out of, but also a place where I could gain great amounts of technical knowledge to apply to my future goals.",

12/21/2021 1:39:35,Rita Vega,Sophomore,Computer Science,,Statistics,Hopefully Technology and management,3.86,Software Development,This team interests me because I am very interested in quantitative trading upon graduation and I am minoring in statistics and majoring in Computer Science to give me the technical background. What I lack is experience and I believe the Software development team would help me gain knowledge and skills that I wouldn't learn in the classroom. ,6-10 hrs per week,I have work experience as a software development intern at Country Financial in Research Park. There I have been exposed to a fast-paced agile environment where interns work on multiple projects at a time and are expected to have production level code ready by the end of the semester. This has allowed me to gain valuable Time Management skills so I would be able to balance the work at Quant with my schoolwork. I also have gained experience in web development and have built a full stack web application from scratch. I am taking CS 411 next semester to gain more backend skills and I believe I am a well rounded applicant for the position. ,I want more exposure to Quantitative finance. It is an area I am seriously looking into for a field I want to get into when I graduate and Quant can give me the experience and the knowledge to know if it's the right place for me. Also I have worked all over the place in software engineering but I still don't necessarily know whether to pursue frontend and backend going forward. The Description on the website makes it seem that the work is very backend focused and that exposure purely being a backend engineer would help me greatly in deciding which route I want to focus on. ,
