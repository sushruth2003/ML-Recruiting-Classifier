# ml-recuriting-classifier

**Difficulty: 5**

Thank you for applying to Quant! We are very interested in your application and want to see what you can do with the skills and knowledge you possess. Please read through the following prompt for what to do.

## **Prompt: ML Recruiting Classifier**

Although data science and machine learning are integral to financial strategy, it is of equal, if not greater, importance to the human factor. Tracking the viability of applicants in a bias-free, algorithmic way is critical to making sure that we at Quant have the best minds working with us. We want to ensure that every interested applicant is appropriately categorized to dedicate resources for assessments and interviews efficaciously.

Your task is to develop a classification model, to rate the quality of each applicant. You have a variety of features, the responses that each applicant provides to our online form, and our classification of the applicant in the last column. This classification is made by analyzing various factors, and your code should closely model our recruiting team's behavior (giving importance to the same features).

Your code should be highly modular, customizable, and absent of technical debt. Your exploration must contain lots of your hanging ideas and explanations based on your choices with the data. Remember to work with only the essential data, drop all irrelevant columns, remove outliers, etc. Also, remember to try out different models to see which one works best.

Your task data is provided within this folder.

## **Resources**

- https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2
- https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests

## **Deliverables**

1. A Jupyter Notebook with all the code and your thought process. (The thought process is what we're looking for, so the more detailed, the better. But keep it concise)
2. A python script that takes in `task.csv` in the exact format as the provided data and generates `output.csv` with your classification predictions.

Optional requirements:
- A report written in `LaTeX`, delivering your opinions about the data, your choice of model, and the accuracy of your model on the test data. 

## **Grading**
We will be looking at your project and grading it under these five criteria:
1. Code
 - If it works
 - Modular
 - Follows best practices (i.e., OOP)
2. Documentation
 - Concise and exact.
 - Follows popular conventions.
 - Visuality. (Lots of graphs and statistics)
3. Styling
 - Human readable
 - Can quickly glance to receive all relevant information
 - Follows Google Style Guide (preferred if it exists) or most popular convention (i.e., PEP8)
4. Robustness
 - Customizable
 - No technical debt (future proof)
 - Handles bad inputs and errors
5. Git
 - [Good commit messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#seven-rules)
 - Commits are appropriately sized
